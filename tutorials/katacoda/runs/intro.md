[Tekton](https://tekton.dev) is a cloud native continuous integration and
delivery (CI/CD) solution. It allows developers to build, test, and deploy
across cloud providers and on-premises systems.

In this scenario, you will learn about Tekton TaskRuns and PipelineRuns,
the custom resources in Tekton for running a specific task or pipeline.
More specifically, **you will create a TaskRun and PipelineRun that
trigger a task and a pipeline respectively, which downloads an app
from GitHub and runs some tests.**

**Note**: You can use the resize button on the top-right corner of this
