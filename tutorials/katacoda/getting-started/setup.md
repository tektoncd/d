## Before you begin

Your Kubernetes cluster is starting and may take a few minutes to be available.
You will see 'Kubernetes started' in the terminal when it is ready.

Run `kubectl cluster-info`{{execute}} in the terminal to check its status.
You should see the following outputs:

```
Kubernetes master is running at ...
KubeDNS is running at ...

...
```

## Installing Tekton

To add Tekton to this experimental Kubernetes cluster, execute the command
below:

<!-- `kubectl apply --filename https://storage.googleapis.com/tekton-releases/pipeline/latest/release.yaml`{{execute}} -->
<!-- Pin to v0.26 since that's the last supported release on Kubernetes 1.18 (environment provided by Katacoda) -->
`kubectl apply --filename https://storage.googleapis.com/tekton-releases/pipeline/previous/v0.26.0/release.yaml`{{execute}}

It may take a few moments for the installation to complete. To monitor the
progress, run the following command:

`kubectl get pods --namespace tekton-pipelines`{{execute}}

Every component listed in the output should have the status `running`.

## Getting the code

Weâ€™ve put everything you need for this scenario in a GitHub repository.
To clone this repository, run the following command:

`git clone https://github.com/tektoncd/website`{{execute}}

Open the directory `website/tutorials/katacoda/getting-started/src`.
The directory consists of three subdirectories and one file:

* `app/`: a simple Python Flask web application.
* `tekton-katacoda/`: Tekton resource specifications you will use in this scenario.
* `Dockerfile`: a Dockerfile for building app/ into a runnable container image.

## Almost done

Tekton is now running in your Katacoda experimental cluster. To help the
installation run smoothly in this special environment, a few extra steps
are required:

```sh
mkdir /mnt/data && kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/pods/storage/pv-volume.yaml && \
kubectl apply -f ~/website/tutorials/katacoda/getting-started/src/tekton-katacoda/init.yaml && \
kubectl delete configmap/config-artifact-pvc -n tekton-pipelines && \
kubectl create configmap config-artifact-pvc --from-literal=storageClassName=manual -n tekton-pipelines
```{{execute}}
