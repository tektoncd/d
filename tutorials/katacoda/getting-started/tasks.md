As introduced earlier, a Tekton CI/CD workflow is a Tekton pipeline with a
number of Tekton tasks, each of which performs an operation, such as
retrieving source code or running the unit tests, in the workflow.

Tekton uses Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions to specify Tekton resources
(tasks, pipelines, etc.). To specify a task, for example, you need to create a
YAML file as follows:

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: Task
metadata:
  name: YOUR-TASK-NAME
spec:
  resources:
    inputs:
      # The input resource(s) of the task, such as a GitHub repository
    outputs:
      # The output resource(s) of the task, such as an image built from the source
  steps:
    ...
    # Each step of the task
```

## Your first Tekton task

First, you will create a simple Tekton task with one step: running all the
tests in `app/`. Naturally, the task requires that Tekton clones the source
code from GitHub, which you can specify in the field `spec.resources.inputs`:

1. Open `website/tutorials/katacoda/getting-started/src/tekton-katacoda/tasks/buildTemplate.yaml`.
2. Edit the file; add a new resource to `spec.resources.inputs`:

    ```yaml
    spec:
      resources:
        inputs:
        - name: git
          type: git
    ```

    `git` is one of the built-in resource types Tekton provides. It specifies
    that the task must take a GitHub repository as input. Here you give it
    the name `git`, which tells Tekton to clone the repository to
    `/workspace/git`.

With the input resource ready, you may now specify the step.
**Each step in Tekton uses a tool image to run some commands**; as an example,
if you are a Go developer, you can use the [Go](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-builders/tree/master/go)
tool image to build a Go program, or run tests in a Go project.

**Note**: [Tekton offers a number of pre-configured tasks you can use](https://github.com/tektoncd/catalog).
You can also find many available images on container registries such as
DockerHub, and [Google Cloud Platform tool images (builder images) GitHub repository](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-builders).
Of course, if you prefer, it is possible to use an image of your own
instead.

In this lab, since `app/` includes a Python web application, you will use the
[Python](https://hub.docker.com/_/python) tool image. In the same file, add a
step to `spec.steps`:

```yaml
steps:
# The name of the step
- name: pytest
  image: python:3.9
  command:
  - /bin/bash
  - -c
  args:
  # Changes to the app/ directory, installs required dependencies, and
  # run all the tests with pytest
  - cd /workspace/git/getting-started/src/app && pip3 install -r requirements.txt && pip3 install -r dev_requirements.txt && pytest .
```

### Add more steps

The code is ready for containerization after all the tests pass. For simplicity
reasons, in this scenario, you will build the container image with Docker and
save it locally (as opposed to pushing it to a remote repository).

Add the following step to the task:

```yaml
steps:
- name: pytest
  ...
- name: docker
  image: docker
  command:
  - docker
  args:
  - build
  - -f
  - /workspace/git/getting-started/src/Dockerfile
  - -t
  - app
  - /workspace/git/getting-started/src
```

This step invokes Docker to build the image and gives it the name `app`.

**Important**: For security reasons, in production systems you should not
use Docker for image building. Alternatives include [Kaniko](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kaniko),
[BuildKit](https://github.com/moby/buildkit), [img](https://github.com/genuinetools/img),
and many more.

Your first Tekton task is now ready. If you have not followed every step above,
a complete task specification is available at
`website/tutorials/katacoda/getting-started/tekton/tasks/build.yaml`.
To apply this task, run the command below:

`cd ~/website/tutorials/katacoda/getting-started/src/tekton-katacoda/ && kubectl apply -f tasks/build.yaml`{{execute}}

## Your second Tekton task (also the last)

The image is now ready for deployment. In this scenario, you will create a
second task for this purpose, which uses the `kubectl` tool image to spin up
the container you just built in the cluster.

1. Open `website/tutorials/katacoda/getting-started/src/tekton-katacoda/tasks/deployTemplate.yaml`.
2. Add the steps:

    ```yaml
    steps:
    # Deploy the image
    - name: deploy
      image: lachlanevenson/k8s-kubectl
      args:
        - run
        - myapp
        - --image=app
    # Expose the image for external acceess
    - name: expose
      image: lachlanevenson/k8s-kubectl
      args:
      - expose
      - pod
      - myapp
      - --port=80
      - --target-port=8080
      - --name=mysvc
      - --type="NodePort"
    ```

    This step uses the [`lachlanevenson/k8s-kubectl`](https://hub.docker.com/r/lachlanevenson/k8s-kubectl)
    tool image.

See `website/tutorials/katacoda/getting-started/src/tekton-katacoda/tasks/deploy.yaml`
for a complete specification of this task. To apply this task, run
the command below:

`cd ~/website/tutorials/katacoda/getting-started/src/tekton-katacoda/ && kubectl apply -f tasks/deploy.yaml`{{execute}}

## A side note

So far you have been using hard-coded values in your tasks. Tekton also
supports variables in its specification, which allows developers
to switch configurations easily at runtime. You can specify
them in `spec.params` and use them in the steps with the
`$(params.YOUR-VAR-NAME)` syntax. For examples, see `build.yaml` and `deploy.yaml`.
