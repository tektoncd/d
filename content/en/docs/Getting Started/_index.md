## Prerequisites

{{% tabs %}}
{{% tab "Kubernetes" %}}
* A Kubernetes cluster with 1.11 or later releases installed.
* Enable [Role-Based Access Control(RBAC)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/)
in the cluster.
* Grant current user `cluster-admin` privileges.

If you are using [Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/),
see [Kubernetes Engine Quickstart](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/quickstart)
for instructions on setting up a Kubernetes cluster. **GKE clusters have RBAC
enabled and persistent volumes available by default**; to grant current user 
the required privilege, run the following command:

```sh
kubectl create clusterrolebinding cluster-admin-binding \
                                  --clusterrole=cluster-admin \
                                  --user=$(gcloud config get-value core/account)
```

For other cloud providers or Minikube installations, refer to their
documentation for more information.
{{% /tab %}}

{{% tab "OpenShift" %}}
* Installing Tekton Pipelines on OpenShift 4/CRC

* Install the [CRC](https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install/crc/installer-provisioned).

1. Install Tekton-Pipeline by accessing the console
2. Select `Catalog/Operator > Operator Hub`
3. Search for `OpenShift Pipelines Operator`
4. Click on `Subscribe` 

**Note**: OpenShift Pipelines Operator will automatically begin installation of Tekton ðŸ˜Š

### Installation

To install the core component of Tekton, Tekton Pipelines, run the command below:

```sh
kubectl apply --filename https://storage.googleapis.com/tekton-releases/pipeline/latest/release.yaml
```

{{% alert title="Note" color="success" %}}
This command automatically installs the latest official release of the
Tekton core component, Tekton Pipelines. If
you would like to install a previous version, use

```
kubectl apply --filename https://storage.googleapis.com/tekton-releases/pipeline/previous/YOUR-VERSION/release.yaml
```

Replace `YOUR-VERSION` with the release you prefer. [You can find the full list
of official Tekton releases on GitHub](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/releases). 

Additionally, Tekton Pipelines pushes nightly releases every night to
`gcr.io/tekton-nightly`. If you are feeling adventurous and would like to
experiment with the most recent, unreleased code, see [Tekton Development Guide](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/master/DEVELOPMENT.md).
{{% /alert %}}

It may take a few moments before the installation completes. You can check
the progress with the following command:

```sh
kubectl get pods --namespace tekton-pipelines
```

Confirm that every component listed has the status `Running`.

### Persistent volumes

To run a CI/CD workflow, you need to provide Tekton a [Persistent Volume](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/)
for storage purposes. Tekton requests a volume of `5Gi` with
the default storage class by default. **Your Kubernetes
cluster, such as one from Google Kubernetes Engine, may have persistent volumes
set up at the time of creation, thus no extra step is required**; if not, you
may have to create them manually. Alternatively, you may ask Tekton
to use a [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage) bucket
or an [AWS Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)
bucket instead. Note that the performance of Tekton may vary depending on
the storage option you choose.

{{% alert title="Note" color="success" %}}
You can check available persistent volumes and storage classes with the
commands below:

```
kubectl get pv
kubectl get storageclasses
```
{{% /alert %}}

These storage options can be configured using [`ConfigMaps`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-pod-configmap/):

{{% tabs %}}
{{% tab "Persistent Volumes" %}}
If you would like to configure the size and storage class of the Persistent
Volume Tekton requests, update the default `config-artifact-pvc` `configMap`.
This `configMap` includes two attributes:

* `size`: the size of the volume
* `storageClassName`: the name of the storage class of the volume

The following example asks Tekton to request a Persistent Volume of `10Gi` with
the `manual` storage class when running a workflow:

```
kubectl create configmap config-artifact-pvc \
                         --from-literal=size=10Gi \
                         --from-literal=storageClassName=manual \
                         -o yaml -n tekton-pipelines | kubectl replace -f -
```
{{% /tab %}}

{{% tab "Buckets" %}}
If you would like to use Google Cloud Storage or AWS S3 buckets instead,
remove the default `config-artifact-pvc` `configMap` and create another
one of the name `config-artifact-bucket`. This `configMap` includes the
following attributes:

* `location`: the address of the bucket, such as `gs://my-gcs-bucket/`
* `bucket.service.account.secret.name`: the name of the
[Kubernetes secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/)
where the service account credentials for accessing the bucket reside.
* `bucket.service.account.secret.key`: the name of the key in the secret which
Tekton should use
* `bucket.service.account.field.name`: the name of the environment variable
to use when setting up the credentials. Defaults to `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`;
use `BOTO_CONFIG` if you plan to use an AWS S3 bucket.

The following example asks Tekton to use a Google Cloud Storage bucket for
storage when running a workflow:

```
kubectl create configmap config-artifact-pvc \
                         --from-literal=location=gs://MY-GCS-BUCKET \
                         --from-literal=bucket.service.account.secret.name=my-secret \
                         --from-literal=bucket.service.account.secret.key=my-key \
                         -o yaml -n tekton-pipelines | kubectl replace -f -
```

And the `my-secret` Kubernetes secret is configured as follows:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: my-secret
type: kubernetes.io/opaque
stringData:
  my-key: MY-SERVICE-ACCOUNT-JSON-KEY
```
{{% /tab %}}
{{% /tabs %}}

Also, Tekton uses the default service account in your Kubernetes cluster
unless otherwise configured; if you would like to override this option,
update the `default-service-account` attribute of the `ConfigMap`
`config-defaults`:

```
kubectl create configmap config-defaults \
                         --from-literal=default-service-account=YOUR-SERVICE-ACCOUNT \
                         -o yaml -n tekton-pipelines | kubectl replace -f -
```

### Set up the CLI

For your convenience, it is recommended that you install the Tekton CLI, `tkn`,
together with the core component of Tekton, Tekton Pipelines.

{{% tabs %}}

{{% tab "macOS" %}}
`tkn` is available on macOS via [`brew`](https://brew.sh/):

```bash
brew tap tektoncd/tools
brew install tektoncd/tools/tektoncd-cli
```

You can also download it as a tarball from the [`tkn` Releases page](https://github.com/tektoncd/cli/releases).
After downloading the file, extract it to your `PATH`:

```bash
# Replace YOUR-DOWNLOADED-FILE with the file path of your own.
sudo tar xvzf YOUR-DOWNLOADED-FILE -C /usr/local/bin/ tkn
```

{{% /tab %}}

{{% tab "Windows" %}}
`tkn` is available on Windows via [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/):

```cmd
choco install tektoncd-cli --confirm
```

You can also download it as a `.zip` file from the [`tkn` Releases page](https://github.com/tektoncd/cli/releases).
After downloading the file, add it to your `Path`:

* Uncompress the `.zip` file.
* Open **Control Panel** > **System and Security** > **System** > **Advanced System Settings**.
* Click **Environment Variables**, select the `Path` variable and click **Edit**.
* Click **New** and add the path to your uncompressed file.
* Click **OK**.
{{% /tab %}}

{{% tab "Linux" %}}
`tkn` is available on Linux as a `.deb` package (for Debian, Ubuntu and
other deb-based distros) and `.rpm` package (for Fedora, CentOS, and other
rpm-based distros).

* Debian, Ubuntu, and other deb-based distros

    Find the `.deb` package of the `tkn` release you would like to install on
    the [`tkn` Releases page](https://github.com/tektoncd/cli/releases) and
    install it with

    ```bash
    # Replace LINK-TO-THE-PACKAGE with the package URL you would like to use.
    rpm -Uvh LINK-TO-THE-PACKAGE
    ```

    If you are using the latest releases of Ubuntu or Debian, you may use the
    TektonCD CLI PPA instead:

    ```bash
    sudo apt update;sudo apt install -y gnupg
    sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 3EFE0E0A2F2F60AA
    echo "deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/tektoncd/cli/ubuntu eoan main"|sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/tektoncd-ubuntu-cli.list
    sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y tektoncd-cli
    ```

* Fedora, CentOS, and other rpm-based distros

    Find the `.rpm` package of the `tkn` release you would like to install on
    the [`tkn` Releases page](https://github.com/tektoncd/cli/releases) and
    install it with

    ```bash
    # Replace LINK-TO-THE-PACKAGE with the package URL you would like to use.
    rpm -Uvh LINK-TO-THE-PACKAGE
    ```

    If you are using Fedora 30/31, CentOS 7/8, EPEL, or RHEL 8, @chmousel
    provides an unofficial `copr` package repository for installing the
    package:

    ```bash
    dnf copr enable chmouel/tektoncd-cli
    dnf install tektoncd-cli
    ```

Alternatively, you may download `tkn` as a tarball:

Find the tarball of the `tkn` release for your platform (`ARM` or `X86-64`)
you would like to install on the [`tkn` Releases page](https://github.com/tektoncd/cli/releases)
and install it with

```bash
# Replace LINK-TO-TARBALL with the package URL you would like to use.
curl -LO LINK-TO-TARBALL
# Replace YOUR-DOWNLOADED-FILE with the file path of your own.
sudo tar xvzf YOUR-DOWNLOADED-FILE -C /usr/local/bin/ tkn
```

## Your first CI/CD workflow with Tekton

With Tekton, each operation in your CI/CD workflow becomes a **step**,
which is executed with a container image you specify. **Steps** are then
organized in **tasks**, which run as a [Kubernetes pod](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-overview/)
in your cluster. If you would like to, you can further organize **tasks**
into **pipelines**.

To create a **task**, create a Kubernetes object using the Tekton API with
the kind `Task`. The following YAML file contains a task with one simple
step, printing a `Hello World!` message using
[the official Ubuntu image](https://hub.docker.com/_/ubuntu/)

To run this task with Tekton, you need to create a **taskRun**, which is
another Kubernetes object using the Tekton API:

```yaml
cat <<EOF | kubectl create -f -
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Task
metadata:
  name: echo
spec:
  steps:
    - name: echo
      image: ubuntu
      command:
        - echo
      args:
        - "Hello World!"
---
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1alpha1
kind: TaskRun
metadata:
  name: getting-started
spec:
  taskRef:
    name: echo
EOF
```

```bash
tkn taskrun logs getting-started
```

It may take a few moments before your task completes. You should see an output
as follows:

```
[echo] Hello World!
```

## What's next

Now you have the core component of Tekton, Tekton Pipelines, installed on
your Kubernetes/OpenShift cluster with the Tekton CLI installed on your local
