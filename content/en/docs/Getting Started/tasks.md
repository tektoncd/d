This tutorial shows you how to 

1. Create a Kubernetes cluster with [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/).
1. Install Tekton pipelines.
1. Create a Task.
1. Use `TaskRun` to instantiate and run the Task.

## Prerequisites

1.  [Install minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/). You only have
    to complete the step 1, "Installation".

1.  [Install kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl).

## Create a Kubernetes cluster

Create a cluster

```bash
minikube start --kubernetes-version v1.24.4
```

The process takes a few seconds, you see an output symilar to the following,
depending on the [minikube driver](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/drivers/)
that you are using:

```
😄  minikube v1.25.1
✨  Using the docker driver based on existing profile
👍  Starting control plane node minikube in cluster minikube
🚜  Pulling base image ...
🔄  Restarting existing docker container for "minikube" ...
🐳  Preparing Kubernetes v1.23.1 on Docker 20.10.12 ...
    ▪ kubelet.housekeeping-interval=5m
    ▪ Generating certificates and keys ...
    ▪ Booting up control plane ...
    ▪ Configuring RBAC rules ...
🔎  Verifying Kubernetes components...
    ▪ Using image gcr.io/k8s-minikube/storage-provisioner:v5
🌟  Enabled addons: storage-provisioner, default-storageclass
🏄  Done! kubectl is now configured to use "minikube" cluster and "default" namespace by default
```

You can check that the cluster was successfully created with `kubectl`:

```bash
kubectl cluster-info
```

The output confirms that Kubernetes is running:

```
Kubernetes control plane is running at https://127.0.0.1:39509
CoreDNS is running at
https://127.0.0.1:39509/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy

To further debug and diagnose cluster problems, use 'kubectl cluster-info dump'.
```

## Install Tekton Pipelines

1. To install the latest version of Tekton Pipelines, use `kubectl`:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply --filename \
   https://storage.googleapis.com/tekton-releases/pipeline/latest/release.yaml
   ```

1. Monitor the installation:

   ```bash
   kubectl get pods --namespace tekton-pipelines --watch
   ```

    When both `tekton-pipelines-controller` and `tekton-pipelines-webhook` show
    `1/1` under the `READY` column, you are ready to continue. For example:

    ```
    NAME                                           READY   STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
    tekton-pipelines-controller-6d989cc968-j57cs   0/1     Pending             0          3s
    tekton-pipelines-webhook-69744499d9-t58s5      0/1     ContainerCreating   0          3s
    tekton-pipelines-controller-6d989cc968-j57cs   0/1     ContainerCreating   0          3s
    tekton-pipelines-controller-6d989cc968-j57cs   0/1     Running             0          5s
    tekton-pipelines-webhook-69744499d9-t58s5      0/1     Running             0          6s
    tekton-pipelines-controller-6d989cc968-j57cs   1/1     Running             0          10s
    tekton-pipelines-webhook-69744499d9-t58s5      1/1     Running             0          20s
    ```

## Create and run a basic Task

A **Task**, represented in the API as an object of kind `Task`, defines a
series of **Steps** that run sequentially to perform logic that the Task
requires. Every Task runs as a pod on the Kubernetes cluster, with each step
running in its own container.

1.  To create a Task, open your favorite editor and create a file named
    `hello-world.yaml` with the following content:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
    kind: Task
    metadata:
      name: hello
    spec:
      steps:
        - name: echo
          image: alpine
          script: |
            #!/bin/sh
            echo "Hello World"
    ```

    


1.  Apply the changes your cluster:

    ```bash
    kubectl apply --filename hello-world.yaml
    ```

      The output confirms that the Task was completed successfully.

      ```
      task.tekton.dev/hello created
      ```

1.  To run this Task, you must instantiate it using `TaskRun`. Create another
    file named `hello-world-run.yaml` with the following content:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
    kind: TaskRun
    metadata:
      name: hello-task-run
    spec:
      taskRef:
        name: hello
    ```

1.  Apply the changes to your cluster to launch the Task:

    ```bash
    kubectl apply --filename hello-world-run.yaml
    ``` 

1.  Verify that everything worked correctly:

    ```bash
    kubectl get taskrun hello-task-run
    ```

    The output of this command shows the status of the Task

     
    ```
     NAME                    SUCCEEDED    REASON       STARTTIME   COMPLETIONTIME
     hello-task-run          True         Succeeded    22h         22h
    ```

    The value `True` under `SUCCEEDED` confirms that TaskRun completed with no errors.


1.  Take a look at the logs:

    ```bash
    kubectl logs --selector=tekton.dev/taskRun=hello-task-run
    ```

    The output displays the message:

    ```
    Hello World
    ```

## Cleanup

To learn about Tekton Pipelines, skip this section and proceed to the [next
tutorial][pipelines-qs].

To delete the cluster that you created for this guide run:

```bash
minikube delete
```

The output confirms that the cluster was deleted:

```
🔥  Deleting "minikube" in docker ...
🔥  Deleting container "minikube" ...
🔥  Removing /home/user/.minikube/machines/minikube ...
💀  Removed all traces of the "minikube" cluster.
```
