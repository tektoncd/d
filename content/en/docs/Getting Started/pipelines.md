  Create and run your first Tekton pipeline

---

This tutorial shows you how to:

- Create two tasks.
- Create a pipeline containing your tasks.
- Use `PipelineRun` to instantiate and run the pipeline containing your tasks.

For this tutorial we are going to use [minikube][minikube] to run the commands
locally.

## Prerequisites

- Complete the [Getting started with tasks](/docs/getting-started/tasks/)
  tutorial. *Do not clean up your resources*, skip the last section.

- [Install the Tekton CLI](/docs/cli/).

## Creating and running a second task

You already have a *Hello World!* task. To create a second *Goodbye World!*
task:

1.  Create a new file named  `goodbye-world.yaml` and add the following
    content:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
    kind: Task
    metadata:
      name: goodbye
    spec:
      steps:
        - name: goodbye
          image: ubuntu
          script: |
            #!/bin/bash
            echo "Goodbye World!"
    ```

1.  Apply your task file:

    ```bash
    kubectl apply --filename goodbye-world.yaml
    ```

When a task is part of a pipeline you don't have to instantiate it, the pipeline
is going to take care of that.

## Creating and running a pipeline

A **[pipeline](/docs/pipelines/pipelines/)** defines an ordered series of tasks
arranged in a specific execution order as part of your CI/CD workflow.

In this section you are going to create your first pipeline, that will include
both the *Hello World!* and *Goodbye World!* tasks.

1.  Create a new file named  `hello-goodbye-pipeline.yaml` and add the following
    content:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
    kind: Pipeline
    metadata:
      name: hello-goodbye
    spec:
      tasks:
        - name: hello
          taskRef:
            name: hello
        - name: goodbye
          runAfter:
            - hello
          taskRef:
            name: goodbye
    ```

1.  Apply your pipeline configuration to your cluster:

    ```bash
    kubectl apply --filename hello-goodbye-pipeline.yaml
    ```

1.  Instantiate your pipeline with a `PipelineRun` object. Create a new file
    named `hello-goodbye-pipeline-run.yaml` with the following content:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
    kind: PipelineRun
    metadata:
      name: hello-goodbye-run
    spec:
      pipelineRef:
        name: hello-goodbye
    ```

1.  Start your pipeline by applying the `PipelineRun` configuration to your
    cluster:

    ```bash
    kubectl apply --filename hello-goodbye-pipeline-run.yaml
    ```

    You see the following output:

    ```bash
    pipelinerun.tekton.dev/hello-goodbye-run created
    ```

    Tekton now starts running your pipeline.

1.  To see the logs of the `PipelineRun`, use the following command:

    ```bash
    tkn pipelinerun logs hello-goodbye-run -f -n default
    ```

    The output shows both Tasks completed successfully:

    <pre>
    [hello : hello] Hello World!

    [goodbye : goodbye] Goodbye World!
    </pre>

## Cleanup

To delete the cluster that you created for this quickstart run:

```bash
minikube delete
```

The output confirms that your cluster was deleted:

<pre>
ðŸ”¥  Deleting "minikube" in docker ...
ðŸ”¥  Deleting container "minikube" ...
ðŸ”¥  Removing /home/user/.minikube/machines/minikube ...
ðŸ’€  Removed all traces of the "minikube" cluster.
</pre>
