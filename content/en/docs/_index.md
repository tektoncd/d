Tekton is a Kubernetes-native continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD)
solution. It allows developers to build, test, and deploy across cloud
providers and on-premise systems.

### Features

* **Standardized CI/CD tooling**: Tekton provides open-source components
so that your CI/CD workflow functions across vendors, languages, and
environments. Tekton artifacts, such as specifications for pipelines and
triggers, work well with Jenkins/Jenkins X, Skaffold, Knative, and
many other popular CI/CD tools.
* **Built-in Best Practices**: With Tekton, you can create cloud-native
CI/CD workflows as quickly as possible. Tekton makes it easy to manage
versions, perform rollbacks, and leverage advanced deployment patterns like
rolling, blue/green, canary, and GitOps.
* **Maximum Flexibility**: You can use Tekton to build, test, and deploy
across multiple environments, including VMs, serverless platforms,
Kubernetes clusters, and Firebase projects. Hybrid environments are also
supported. Since Tekton abstracts the underlying implementation away,
you and your team can experiment with workflows and switch configurations
as you see fit.
